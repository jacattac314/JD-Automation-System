# App Icons

Place your application icons in this directory:

- `icon.png` - Main app icon (512x512 or larger, PNG format)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (generated by electron-builder)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (generated by electron-builder)

For now, electron-builder will generate default icons if these are not present.

## Recommended Icon Sizes

- **PNG**: 1024x1024 (will be resized as needed)
- **ICO**: 256x256 (Windows)
- **ICNS**: 512x512 (macOS)

## Icon Generation

The build process will automatically generate platform-specific icons from icon.png using electron-builder.
